# Text Bubbles Video

Hi there. My name is Akuya.

I'd like to make a text bubbles kinda app. To help with the videos
I want to start making.

As I figure out my video set up. I thought I could just write down
my thoughts as I code.

This idea is heavily inspired by Takuya (aka Devaslife). Check him
out on YouTube.

Anyway, let's start building.

It's going to be a React app. Let's set that up.

The bottom right side of the video is where the text bubbles
are going to appear. The big square on the right is a fuller view of the app.
